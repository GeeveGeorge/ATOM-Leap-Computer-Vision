( The video contains the first prototype of the wearable , it also contains the images from the MIT Media Lab Workshop were I worked along with my buddy Sarthak Sethi we made it to the Top 10 projects.
( I am currently working at the MIT Kumbh Initiative supported by the MIT Media Lab Camera Culture Group and  Head of Camera Culture Group Prof.Ramesh Raskar who supports me and encourages us to create innovation!  )

Inspired by ATOM from Real steel(2011 movie) , a robot that has a hidden ability of sight which turns this machine into the best boxing bot in the world. Watching the movie made me realize the power of technology , how technology can be used to provide sight to the blind!Now I'd am happy to announce ATOM! "The world's first wearable for the blind" and the most feasible wearable for the blind.The first prototype is successfully completed , currently I am building the final product to be delivered in the market!
